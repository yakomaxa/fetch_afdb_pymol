# fetch_afdb_pymol

after sourcing the script for pymol (run afdb.py)

``af UNIPROTID``

fetches the corresponding alphafold-database structure model.

For example,

``af A0A452S449``

This script is modification of the ``fetch`` command from PyMOL source code.

There're many unused pieces of code, so it's welcomed to cleaning them up on PR.
